                <p><strong>- Don't use an email provider that spys on you. PLEASE!</strong></p><small>If you're sending from a Google, Yahoo, Outlook, or similar address, don't get a false sense of security - everything you are typing as you compose your email is being sent back to a data-center, mostly used for tailored advertising.</small><a href="https://edit.tosdr.org/points/13935">&nbsp;Example from Google's Privacy Policy</a>

                <p><strong>- Use universally adopted encryption standards - looking at you Tutanota</strong></p><small>The more people that adopt a standard system of encryption, the more secure the entire user-base of that encryption is. If you use Tutanota, note that while I do maintain a Tutanota account to receive emails, you should strongly consider adopting PGP email with a provider like Proton or via self-hosting.</small>
